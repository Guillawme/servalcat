# Servalcat
**S**tructur**e** **r**efinement and **val**idation for **c**rystallography and single p**a**r**t**icle analysis

Currently we focus on development for single particle analysis and there are only a few functions at the moment.

## Installation

Here is the *dev-gemmi-pre* branch, which requires a github version of GEMMI (ahead of official release).

So you always need to install the latest GEMMI:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
pip install git+https://github.com/keitaroyam/servalcat.git@dev-gemmi-pre
```
Add `-U` option for updating.

The required GEMMI commit is written in the commit message.

## Usage
See [README in the main branch](https://github.com/keitaroyam/servalcat/blob/main/README.md)
